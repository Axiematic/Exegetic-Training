Often the data you need is already available on a website. It might all be on one page (if you're lucky!) or distributed across many pages (possibly hundreds or thousands of pages!).

But you want those data consolidated locally. Not on a server in some distant land, but right there on your hardware. And in a convenient format. CSV or JSON, perhaps? Certainly not HTML!

What would Ragnar do? He'd go out, grab those data and bring them home.

## Objectives

The contemporary Internet Viking uses web scraping techniques to systematically extract information from web pages. This workshop will demonstrate the process of web scraping.

## Who should attend?

This tutorial will be suitable for Vikings with low to moderate levels of R experience.

## Course Content

Here’s the battle plan:

- Sharpening the Axe: Understanding the structure of an HTML document.
- Preparing the Longships: Using the DOM to select HTML elements.
- Doing Battle: Using {rvest} to extract data from an HTML document.
- Stashing the Treasure: Storing data as CSV or JSON.
- Triumphant Return: Handling dynamic content using {RSelenium}.

## Outcomes

The first two topics will be fairly brief, covering this material at a high level. We'll dig much deeper into the latter topics. By the end of the workshop you will be able to easily (and confidently) scrape large swathes of the internet. We’re considerate Vikings, so you’ll also learn how to do this ethically and mindfully.
    
## Requirements
We'll use RStudio Cloud to ensure that everybody has the same infrastructure and (hopefully) avoid most technical issues.          

## Interactive course material
          
Our training emphasises practical skills. So, although you'll be learning concepts and theory, you'll see how everything is applied in the real world as we work through examples and exercises based on real datasets.

## We like questions!
          
Having a firm understanding of the course content will result in you being able to confidently apply your new skills. So, if at any point you're unsure of something, just ask!
