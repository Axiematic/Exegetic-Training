## Objectives

The workshop will introduce you to the fundamental concepts behind Deep Learning and show you how to get started building models using Python and Keras. You'll learn some of the underlying maths (a PhD in Mathematics will not be required!) and work through several examples.

You’ll walk away with an appreciation for what’s possible with Deep Learning and sufficient hands-on experience to start building your own models.

All material will be available as Jupyter Notebooks.

## Setup

You'll need the following to get the most out of the workshop:

- a laptop and
- an account on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

If you have not used Jupyter Notebooks before, then quickly read through the following resources:

- [What is the Jupyter Notebook?](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb)
- [Notebook Basics](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb)
- [Running Code](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb) and
- [Markdown Cells](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.ipynbs).
