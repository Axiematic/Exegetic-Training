## Objectives

In this course you’ll learn how to use R to selectively scrape content from static & dynamic websites.
          
## Outcomes

Participants will be able to isolate the relevant portions of a website and write scripts to automatically extract the required information. Furthermore they’ll know how to apply these techniques to both static and dynamic websites.

## Who should attend?

Students, academics or professionals who need to harvest data from the internet.

## Requirements
          
Participants are assumed to have prior exposure to R, or at least to programming of some variety. Some familiarity with HTML and CSS will be an advantage but not mandatory. We'll be using an online development environment. This means that you can focus on learning without having to worry about solving technical problems.

## Interactive course material
          
Our training emphasises practical skills. So, although you'll be learning concepts and theory, you'll see how everything is applied in the real world as we work through examples and exercises based on real datasets.

## We like questions!
          
Having a firm understanding of the course content will result in you being able to confidently apply your new skills. So, if at any point you're unsure of something, just ask!
