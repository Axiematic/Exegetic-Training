> Imagine you are coloring in a flower coloring book. You colored in green for all leaves and now it’s time for the best part, coloring the petal. You know you enjoy red the best but it looked horrible after you finished it. With Git, you can revert your choice of red in a heartbeat and you are free to reapply the red if you change your mind. A work doesn’t have to be permanent; every action is recorded and reversible<br> - [Mac Siri](https://dev.to/maestromac/comment/him?source=post_page---------------------------)

## Scope and objectives

After this course, you’ll be familiar with how Git works and primed to start using it on your own projects. We'll cover:

1. Why Version Control?
2. Setting Up Git
3. Creating a Repository
4. Committing to the Repository
5. Tracking Changes
6. Retrieving from the Repository
7. Branches
8. Git as a Tool for Collaboration
9. Remote Repository
10. UIs

#### Interactive course material
          
Our training emphasises practical skills. So, although you'll be learning concepts and theory, you'll see how everything is applied in the real world as we work through examples and exercises based on real datasets.

#### We like questions!
          
Having a firm understanding of the course content will result in you being able to confidently apply your new skills thereafter. So, if at any point you're unsure of something, just ask!

## Who should attend?

1. Data analysts
2. Developers
3. Researchers
4. Anyone who wants to safely store their files
5. Anyone who works in collaboration with others
          
## Why should I learn to use Git?
          
1. "It was working a moment ago but now it's broken." Git's got your back, roll back to an earlier commit!
2. "This project is huge! I don't know where to start!" Git will help train your brain to break down a big project into smaller bite-sized, committable, chunks. This will help you devise a better, less overwhelming game plan.
          
## Requirements
          
All you'll need is a computer with a browser. We'll be using an online development environment. This means that you can focus on learning without having to worry about solving technical problems.
