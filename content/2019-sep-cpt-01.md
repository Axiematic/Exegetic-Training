<!-- > Imagine you are coloring in a flower coloring book. You colored in green for all leaves and now it’s time for the best part, coloring the petal. You know you enjoy red the best but it looked horrible after you finished it. With Git, you can revert your choice of red in a heartbeat and you are free to reapply the red if you change your mind. A work doesn’t have to be permanent; every action is recorded and reversible<br> - [Mac Siri](https://dev.to/maestromac/comment/him?source=post_page---------------------------)

## Objectives

<p style="margin-bottom: .5rem!important;">This course will give you a solid understanding of the principles and practices of applying Version Control with Git. You’ll learn to</p>

- setup Git on your computer and create a repository;
- perform everyday Version Control operations (checking in, checking out, diffing, branching, merging);
- create a remote repository on GitHub and synchronise it with your local repository; and
- how to use Git as an effective collaboration tool.

## Outcomes 

After this course you’ll be familiar with how Git works and primed to start using it on your own projects.

## Who should attend?

1. Data analysts
2. Developers
3. Researchers
4. Anyone who wants to safely store their files
5. Anyone who works in collaboration with others

## Why should I learn to use Git?
          
1. Using Git will mean that you have a complete history of revisions (and the ability to revert to older versions if something breaks or you change your mind).
2. Pull requests allow developers to request to have their branches merged into the master branch while allowing project leads to keep track of new changes.
3. Free backups.
4. Branches - we'll chat more about these in during the course but branches allow developers to work on something new (and see exactly how it'll work/look within the existing project) while ensuring that the master branch always contains production-quality work.
5. "This project is huge! I don't know where to start!" Git will help train your brain to break down a big project into smaller bite-sized, committable, chunks. This will help you devise a better, less overwhelming game plan.
6. Enables effective collaboration.

## Requirements
          
All you'll need is a computer with a browser. We'll be using an online development environment. This means that you can focus on learning without having to worry about solving technical problems.

#### Interactive course material
          
Our training emphasises practical skills. So, although you'll be learning concepts and theory, you'll see how everything is applied in the real world as we work through examples and exercises based on real datasets.

#### We like questions!
          
Having a firm understanding of the course content will result in you being able to confidently apply your new skills thereafter. So, if at any point you're unsure of something, just ask!
