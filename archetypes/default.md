## Objectives

#### Interactive course material

Our training emphasises practical skills. So, although you'll be learning concepts and theory, you'll see how everything is applied in the real world as we work through examples and exercises based on real datasets.

#### We like questions!

Having a firm understanding of the course content will result in you being able to confidently apply your new skills thereafter. So, if at any point you're unsure of something, just ask!

## Who should attend?

## Why should I attend?

## Requirements

All you'll need is a computer with a browser. We'll be using an online development environment. This means that you can focus on learning without having to worry about solving technical problems.
